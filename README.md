Yeah, we are going to create a draft PR and convert it to the "Ready for
Review" to check if the workflow is triggered correctly.

Then, we'll merge the PR to make sure the final trigger on "main" worked.

Another line to check that this commit won't trigger a new workflow run as it's
a push to the PR branch, not main.
